This folder provides the demo for
 1) Robust PCA on graphs: published in IEEE ICCV 2015
 2) Fast Robust PCA on graphs: published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing 2016
 
  
 VERY IMPORTANT: PLEASE download and install the following two open source toolboxes. The code relies on these toolboxes
 1. UNLOCBOX: https://lts2.epfl.ch/unlocbox/
 2. GSPBOX: https://lts2.epfl.ch/gsp/
 
  The code provides a clustering demo for the 30 classes of ORL dataset. The dataset is provided in the folder
 The main file is 'demo_PCAG.m'. The code is well commented. 
 Do not forget to tune the parameters for both models for the best results.
