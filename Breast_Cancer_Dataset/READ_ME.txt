Please find two Matlab files called 'Outlier_Detection_using_C_matrix.m' and 'F_Score_Separability_and_Visualization.m'. 

Run 'Outlier_Detection_using_C_matrix.m' to compare GOP, OP, Gaussian density method, MAD and Boxplot for outlier detection on different dimensions.

Run 'F_Score_Separability_and_Visualization.m'  to compare F score, Separability and visualization of GOP, OP, PCA and t-SNE. 

BEFORE RUNNING THESE SCRIPTS, PLEASE donwload TCGA Breast cancer dataset following instructions in 'Download Breast cancer TCGA dataset.txt'.
