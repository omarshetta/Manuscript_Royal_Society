Please find two Matlab files called 'Outlier_Detection_using_C_matrix.m' and 'F_Score_Separability_and_Visualization.m'. 

Run 'Outlier_Detection_using_C_matrix.m' to compare GOP, OP, Gaussian density method, MAD and Boxplot for outlier detection on different dimensions.

Run 'F_Score_Separability_and_Visualization.m'  to compare F score, Separability and visualization of GOP, OP, PCA and t-SNE. 

For simplicity we included the single-cell cell cycle dataset in this folder; 'Test_1_mECS.mat'. We downloaded 'Test_1_m_ECS.RData' from https://github.com/BatzoglouLabSU/SIMLR and converted it to a MATLAB .mat file.
