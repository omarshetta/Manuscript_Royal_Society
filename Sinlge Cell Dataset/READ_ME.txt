Please find two Matlab files called 'Outlier_Detection_using_C_matrix.m' and 'F_Score_Separability_and_Visualization.m'. 

Run 'Outlier_Detection_using_C_matrix.m' to compare GOP, OP, Gaussian density method, MAD and Boxplot for outlier detection on different dimensions.

Run 'F_Score_Separability_and_Visualization.m'  to compare F score, Separability and visualization of GOP, OP, PCA and t-SNE. 

VERY IMPORTANT: PLEASE download and install the following open source toolbox. The code relies on this
GSPBOX: https://lts2.epfl.ch/gsp/
After downloading unzip and copy 'gspbox' folder to this directory.
