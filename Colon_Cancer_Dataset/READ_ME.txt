Please find the Matlab file called 'colon_code.m'

Run 'colon_code.m' to generate outlier detection and visualization results for colon cancer dataset.
In addition, gives example on how to tune the regularization parameter 'lambda' for OP and GOP, and shows robustness of GOP to parameter 'gamma'.

The colon cancer dataset is downloaded from http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/oncology/affydata/ 
The matrix 'I2000' (colon gene expression data) and 'tissues' (label of tumor and normal samples) are downloaded and converted to .mat files. 
We have included both .mat files in this directory for simplicity.
